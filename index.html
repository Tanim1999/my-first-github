    <h1><i>The laws of stoics</i></h1>
    <div class="facts">
        <ul>
            <li>Stoics never rely on luck.</li>
            <li>Stoics rely on their hard work.</li>
            <li>stoics don't expect a work to be easy. No matter how hard the work is they keep doing the work until they become successful.</li>
            <li>Their brain is wired such a way that if they want something they just get it.</li>
            <li>They are totally aware of the fact that hard work beats talent when talent doesn't hard work.</li>
            <li>Stoics always look at the bigger picture and avoid temporary comforts.</li>
            <li>A stoic will take the hardship on his shoulder so that his family can live comfortably</li>
            <li>Stoics compete with self only. They believe in getting better than yesterday.</li>
            <li>stoics are always patient about rewards.They don't pay attention to rewards. Instead they put attention in the process and they know the reward is just a consequence.</li>
            <li>stoics need no motivation to work. If there is something that will make them better than yesterday they will just do it.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Don't run away from pain. Embrace it, cause the only thing it will do for you is make you stronger!</p> 
    <p>Stoicism takes its name from the place where its founder, Zeno of Citium (Cyprus), customarily lecturedâ€”the Stoa Poikile (Painted Colonnade). Zeno, who flourished in the early 3rd century bce, showed in his own doctrines the influence of earlier Greek attitudes, particularly those mentioned above.</p>
